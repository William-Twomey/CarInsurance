# CarInsurance
Car Insurance Project 
For this project I mimiced a car insurance website. 
Using the users input it calculates a quote based on business logic. 
I also implemented an admin page so that people can view the quotes that have already been issued.
This was a really fun project to work on using the Entity Framework and getting expereance with CRUD operations, bootstrap 5, C# and the MVC architecture.
